## About the Design

This design utilizes an instrumentation amplifier (IA) and a comparator (CMP) to form a closed-loop thermal bias control system. This structure monitors the temperature-dependent current by converting it to voltage and comparing it against a target reference. The feedback mechanism employs a up-down counter to digitally adjust the bias current, ensuring dynamic stability across thermal variations.
